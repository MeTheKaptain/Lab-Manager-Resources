## 1. General Lab Duties

### Daily

* clock in and out to log hours appropriately
	- Augie does not like to go in and adjust timesheets
	- make sure you are getting paid for your work! 
* check biohazard waste bins and autoclave when full
* store and organize packages as they are delivered
	- dry storage
	- fridge storage *(4&deg;C)*
	- freezer storage *(-20&deg;C)*
	- freezer storage *(-80&deg;C)*
	- nitrogen storage *(-196&deg;C)*

### Weekly

* make necessary orders for the lab
	- check counts of consumables for low stocks regularly
	- feel free to implement a notification system for other lab members to let you know when stocks are low
	- the standard is to be notified with things are **low**, not completely out
	- delivery turnaround times are varied, understanding them will come with experience *(other lab members will be able to help learn this)*
* empty cold box drip buckets
* autoclave necessary consumables
	- pipette tips
	- Pasteur pipettes
	- 1.7mL tubes
	- 5mL tubes
	- culture flasks
	- wooden applicators *(sticks)*
	- toothpicks *(properly oriented)*
	- other
* present data and general lab discussion in lab meeting
* check functions of the eye wash station
* check CO2 tank levels in BRC464 and BRC457
	- replace with spare tank when needed *(and order an additional spare to replace it)*
* refill low ddH2O and EtOH squirt bottles
 
### Monthly

* reconcile monthly purchases for the lab *(pcard use)*
* scrape the -80&deg;C freezer
* refill the liquid nitrogen dewar

### Yearly

* thaw the -20&deg;C freezer *(typically after/during the summer)*
* change the filters of the Milli-Q water purifier
* change the air filters on the CO2 incubators *(typically every two years, some are on alternating years I think)*

### Miscellaneous/As Needed

* make consumable buffers and reagents for general lab use
	- native gel assay running buffers
	- 2M magnesium solution
	- LB broth *(300mL volumes and 1.5L volumes)*
	- LB agar *(300mL volumes)*
	- 20mg/mL FAF BSA *(and aliquot for -80&deg;C storage)*
	- others are surely being forgotten but will be mentioned when necessary by other lab members
* autoclave water and 80% glycerol in small volumes
* make lab meeting schedule and presentation schedule *(reserve larger conference rooms when needed)*
* send lab coats to be cleaned *(9th floor bucket drop-off)*
* replace drying mats
	- sinks, cell culture, and chemical/equipment bench
* have the department order printer toner *(Brother printer in Dr. Mooers’ room)*
* refill the hand soap dispenser
* stock EtOH jugs from the iLabs ethanol vault
* clean the used spatulas and scoopulas
* empty the vacuum waste on the bench top *(just yours)*
* empty the cell culture vacuum waste when full *(464 and 457)*
